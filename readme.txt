A visual WordPress page builder with nested containers, CSS Grid, templates, a design system, and responsive editing.

== Description ==

Canvasly is a visual page builder for WordPress. Design a page on a canvas, then publish it the usual WordPress way. The editor has a unit library, desktop, tablet, and mobile views, and a design system for colors, type, and reusable parts.

Canvasly keeps its own document model, unit API, editor, CSS and JavaScript, icon library, and REST endpoints. It stays out of the normal WordPress block editor except for the Canvasly Template block and an **Edit with Canvasly** launcher.

Start with the [Canvasly documentation](https://canvasly.pro/overview.html). Unlock theme parts, shop units, popups, form logging, hosted payments, and AI connectivity with **[Canvasly Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html)**.

### Create professional websites

- **[Visual drag-and-drop editor](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html#how-to-add)**: Build a page from the unit library. Search or filter by category, then drop a unit into a Container, a Grid, or the page.
- **[Layout and style controls](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html)**: Typography, spacing, sizing, borders, shadows, positioning, visibility, CSS classes, custom CSS, ARIA attributes, and responsive settings. Image units add size, link, lightbox, caption, alt text, object fit, and object position.
- **[Templates](https://canvasly.pro/shortcodes.html)**: Save a layout and place it with `[canvasly_lite_template id="42"]`, `[canvasly_lite_template title="Homepage hero"]`, the Canvasly Template block, the Template unit, or the Canvasly Template sidebar widget.
- **[Free units](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html)**: Layout, basic, media, content, and advanced units, including Heading, Image, Button, Gallery, Video, Tabs, Form, Price Table, and Collection Loop.
- **[Canvasly Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Theme Builder, theme units, popups, extra form fields, shop units when WooCommerce is active, hosted payments, editor notes, and an AI connection with MCP.

= Key features =

- **[Design system](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html#design-system)**: Global colors, typography, variables, classes, and components. Classes support base, hover, focus, active, and focus-visible. Components expose properties and update every instance. Site kits export and import settings, tokens, classes, components, templates, and optional pages.
- **[Responsive design](https://canvasly.pro/overview.html)**: Edit desktop, tablet, and mobile on the canvas. Extra breakpoints can be turned on under Design System.
- **[CSS Grid](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html#grid)**: Columns, rows, explicit tracks, gaps, auto-flow, dense placement, outlines, and per-child span and alignment. Drag an edge to resize; neighboring columns share the width.
- **Entrance and exit motion**: About 50 CSS presets, custom keyframes, and viewport, load, hover, click, focus, and scroll-progress triggers. Timing, per-breakpoint exclusions, reduced motion, and an editor preview are included. The interaction script loads only when a document uses it.
- **Dynamic tags**: Post, author, site, user, archive, and term values, with before, after, and fallback text. Previews resolve in the editor and on the front end. [Canvasly Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro) adds request values, custom fields, ACF, and product price and SKU.
- **[History and revisions](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html#context-menu)**: Undo, redo, an action history you can jump through, WordPress revisions with a canvas preview, and autosave recovery. Copy, paste, and paste-style work across pages and tabs.
- **[Settings, roles, and tools](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html)**: General, Integrations, Advanced, Performance, Tools, and Features. Units Manager and Role Manager control which units each role can use. Maintenance and Coming Soon, per-user Safe Mode, System Info, Replace URL, and rollback from stored plugin ZIPs live under Tools.
- **Developer surface**: REST routes under `canvasly-lite/v1` with capability checks and nonces. WP-CLI: `wp canvasly-lite regenerate-css`, `flush-cache`, `replace-url`, `import`, `export`, and `convert`.
- **Sticky, scroll, and page transitions [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Stick to the top or bottom, scroll opacity, slide, and scale, scroll snap, and page transitions.
- **[Theme Builder](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html#pro-units) [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Header, footer, single, archive, search, 404, and section templates, with display rules.
- **[Popups](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html#other-surfaces) [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Open on load, scroll, click, exit, or inactivity. A link can open a popup. Frequency uses a cookie set by the site.
- **Forms [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Lite sends one email. Pro adds number, date, radio, acceptance, and file fields, plus email, redirect, webhook, a submissions log, and CSV export.
- **[WooCommerce](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html#pro-units) [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Product and product-archive templates, product units, menu cart, and notices. Cart, checkout, and My Account print WooCommerce’s own forms. Shop units load only while WooCommerce is active.
- **[Hosted payments](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro) [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#plans)**: Stripe, PayPal, Square, Razorpay, Mollie, and Authorize.net. Card data stays on the gateway.
- **[AI connection and MCP](https://canvasly.pro/ai-connectivity.html) [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Store a provider key and let an agent read the layout through WordPress. Saving a page still requires a WordPress user who can edit layouts.
- **Editor notes [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/blocks.html#other-surfaces)**: Notes on a unit for people who can edit the page. Notes are not printed on the site.
- **Custom code, fonts, and icons [Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro)**: Site-wide snippets, uploaded font files, and extra icon sets. Lite includes per-unit CSS, Google Fonts, and the icon manager.

### Faster pages

Canvasly prints CSS for the units a page uses, and it can write that CSS to files under `uploads/canvasly-lite/css` with a hash in the file name. Details are under [Settings → Performance](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html#performance) and [Settings → Advanced](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html#advanced).

- **Optimized markup**: An optional mode that drops an extra wrapper on simple units.
- **Scripts**: A unit’s scripts and styles load only when that unit is on the page.

Build the rest of the site with **[Canvasly Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html)**.

= Security =

Canvasly checks WordPress capabilities on admin screens and REST routes, validates nonces, and sanitizes and escapes stored content. SVG uploads go through sanitization. reCAPTCHA secret keys are not sent to the browser. Pro API keys are encrypted at rest, and the editor never receives them. See [AI connectivity](https://canvasly.pro/ai-connectivity.html) for how provider hosts and MCP tokens are limited.

= Accessibility =

Units use HTML you can label, including alt text, ARIA attributes, and semantic tags on Container. The editor includes checks for common image, heading, and button issues. Motion respects reduced-motion preferences. Menus from the Site Menu unit expose an accessible name.

= Translations =

Canvasly ships a `canvasly-lite` text domain (`languages/canvasly-lite.pot`). Editor strings can be translated with the usual WordPress translation tools. RTL layouts follow the site language.

= Third-party services =

These run only when you turn the related feature on:

- **Google Fonts** load when a document uses a Google font family and self-hosting is off. Google’s [Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) apply. You can download the files and serve them from the site under [Settings → Advanced](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html#advanced).
- **Google Maps** uses the Maps Embed API when you save an API key and enable the Maps feature. Otherwise the map uses the public Google Maps iframe. The same Google policies apply.
- **reCAPTCHA** (Google) runs on forms when Form reCAPTCHA is on and both keys are saved.
- **oEmbed** uses WordPress `wp_oembed_get` for Video and Audio fallbacks, lone-URL HTML units, and the Embed unit. Results are cached. Only allowed hosts are requested.
- **Canvasly Pro AI providers** are called only when an administrator presses Test connection on [AI Connection](https://canvasly.pro/ai-connectivity.html). Supported hosts are OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Azure OpenAI, Perplexity, Cursor, Groq, Mistral, and DeepSeek. MCP traffic stays on your WordPress site and is not forwarded to those providers.

Questions about install, settings, or a page that will not open: [Contact support](https://canvasly.pro/support.html). Common answers are in the [FAQ](https://canvasly.pro/faq.html).

== Installation ==

= Minimum requirements =

* WordPress 6.9 or greater
* PHP 7.4 or greater
* MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB 10.3 or greater

= Recommended =

* WordPress 6.9 or greater, tested up to 7.1
* PHP 8.1 or greater

Shop units appear only while WooCommerce is active. [Canvasly Pro](https://canvasly.pro/installation.html) will not start if Canvasly is missing, switched off, or older than 0.12.73.

= Installation =

1. Install using **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**, or place the plugin folder in `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate **Canvasly** on the Plugins screen.
3. Open a page or post and choose **Edit with Canvasly**. The same link is in the admin bar.
4. Drag units from the left library onto the canvas, then save. Publish or update the page in WordPress.

Step-by-step install for Canvasly and Canvasly Pro, including the license screen, is in the [installation guide](https://canvasly.pro/installation.html). Settings for post types, CSS, fonts, maps, and performance are in the [settings guide](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install Canvasly? =

From the WordPress dashboard go to Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin, upload the Canvasly zip, then Activate. You can also copy the plugin folder into `wp-content/plugins/`. The [installation guide](https://canvasly.pro/installation.html) covers Canvasly Pro as well.

= What does Canvasly require? =

WordPress 6.9 or later and PHP 7.4 or later. The plugin is tested up to WordPress 7.1. Canvasly Pro also needs Canvasly 0.12.73 or newer.

= How do I edit a page? =

Open the page and choose **Edit with Canvasly**, or use the admin-bar link. Posts and Pages work as soon as you activate the plugin. Other public types stay off until you enable them under Canvasly → Settings → General.

= Where are the settings? =

[Canvasly → Settings](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html) covers post types, maps, reCAPTCHA, CSS, fonts, performance, tools, and experiments. Colors, type, and breakpoints are under Design System.

= Does Canvasly work with my theme and with Gutenberg? =

On the normal WordPress editing screen, Canvasly does not load its full editor. The Canvasly Template block and the Edit with Canvasly launcher still appear. You can turn off Canvasly’s default colors and fonts so the theme keeps those. See the [FAQ](https://canvasly.pro/faq.html).

= Do I need to know how to code? =

No. The free unit library, templates, and design system cover a typical page. Custom CSS, HTML, and the Code unit are there when you want them.

= Can I reuse a section on another page? =

Right-click a Container or Grid and choose Save as Template. Place it later with the Template unit, `[canvasly_lite_template id="42"]`, the Canvasly Template block, or the Canvasly Template sidebar widget. Attributes are listed on the [shortcodes page](https://canvasly.pro/shortcodes.html).

= Why is a unit missing from the library? =

Units Manager can disable a type or hide it from your role. Nested Tabs, Accordion, and Toggle, Collection Loop, and Grid container can also be switched off under Settings → Features. Shop units are absent unless WooCommerce is active. Pro units are absent unless [Canvasly Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html) has started.

= Will Canvasly slow down my site? =

CSS and scripts load for the units on the page. You can print CSS as external files, cache non-dynamic unit HTML, lazy-load images, and self-host Google Fonts. See [Performance](https://canvasly.pro/settings.html#performance).

= How do I move the site to a new address? =

Use Canvasly → Settings → Tools → Replace URL. Run Dry run first. The replacement cannot be undone from that screen.

= What is the difference between Canvasly and Canvasly Pro? =

Canvasly is the free page builder: the visual editor, the free unit library, the design system, entrance and exit motion, page templates, the collection loop, and basic dynamic tags. [Canvasly Pro](https://canvasly.pro/price.html#lite-vs-pro) adds Theme Builder, popups, shop units, hosted payments, extra form actions, editor notes, and the AI connection. Every Pro plan includes the same features.

= The editor looks broken. What should I try? =

Under Settings → Advanced, set Editor loader to Iframe. Under Settings → Tools, turn on Safe mode for your account. Safe mode loads the editor without other plugins and without the theme. More answers are in the [FAQ](https://canvasly.pro/faq.html).

Does Canvasly work with other page builders? =

Canvasly is a standalone page builder and does not require any other builder. If Elementor is installed and active on your site, Canvasly can:

* Import pages, posts and library templates that were built with Elementor into new Canvasly documents. The original content is never changed or deleted.
* Show a theme header or footer built with Elementor correctly in the Canvasly editor, by loading the stylesheets that your installed copy of Elementor already provides.

Canvasly does not include, copy or redistribute any Elementor code, stylesheets or images. It only references the files already installed on your site, and this compatibility only applies while Elementor is active.

= Is Canvasly affiliated with Elementor? =

No. Elementor is a trademark of its respective owner. Canvasly is an independent plugin and is not affiliated with, sponsored by or endorsed by Elementor or its owner. The name is used only to describe compatibility.

= Where do I get help? =

Read the [documentation](https://canvasly.pro/overview.html) or [contact support](https://canvasly.pro/support.html).

== Changelog ==

= 0.12.108 =
* Fixed: WordPress Plugin Check errors — editor document JSON is printed with wp_print_inline_script_tag(), Elementor source badges are passed through wp_kses(), shortcode and Elementor frontend stylesheets are printed by core's WP_Styles printer instead of hand-built link tags, and strip_tags() is replaced with wp_strip_all_tags().

= 0.12.107 =
* Changed: A unit border with a Border Style but no Border Color now defaults to white instead of the text colour (which drew a thick dark box). Set Border Color to choose another colour. The Button unit keeps its existing behaviour.

= 0.12.106 =
* Added: Site Menu > Style > Menu Button: Text, Border, Hover Text, Hover Background and Hover Border for the menu (dropdown / hamburger) button. Blank hover values fall back to the menu Hover colour and the button Background.
* Added: Style > Button and Button Hover colours (text, background, border) for Form, Login and Link in Bio buttons, and Hover Color / Hover Background / Hover Border for Collection Loop pagination and Load More. Themes can no longer recolour these buttons on hover.
* Fixed: Sliders showed a value of 0 at the far-left (minimum) position. On Text Shadow X/Y and similar sliders that start at -50, the thumb sat at -50 while the value was 0, so a small nudge saved -50 by accident (this caused a faded duplicate of Site Menu text). A 0 value now sits at 0.

= 0.12.105 =
* Fixed: Site Menu button turned the theme's button colour (for example red) on hover and after a click, instead of keeping its Background colour and switching the text to the Hover colour. Themes that style every button on hover/focus no longer override it, in the editor or on the saved page.
* Fixed: The same theme override affected other Canvasly buttons on hover/focus: Tabs and Nested Tabs titles, the Alert close button, the Video play button, Image Carousel arrows and dots, and Loop Grid arrows and dots. They now keep their own colours.

= 0.12.104 =
* Fixed: Hover colours did not show in the editor canvas for Button, Heading, Text Editor, Price Table and other units. The canvas draws these units with inline colours, which outranked every :hover rule. Hover and focus rules now win in the canvas; the saved page was not affected.
* Fixed: Site Menu "Hover" colour now also applies to the menu button (the "My Menu" dropdown button and the mobile hamburger), in the editor and on the saved page.
* Fixed: Social Icons "Hover Background" had no effect on the saved page or in the editor; a more specific base rule kept the normal background.
* Fixed: When a container or unit was selected in the editor, its resize strips sat on top of the content along its edges (menu links, an open dropdown, child units) and blocked hover there. The strips now let the pointer through while it is over content; the outer half of each strip and the corner squares still resize.

= 0.12.103 =
* Fixed: Site Menu "Hover" colour (Style > Site Menu > Hover) had no effect in the editor canvas or on the saved page; links always used the Site Settings link hover colour (e.g. red). The global link colour rule outranked the Site Menu's own rules. Site Menu, Icon, Icon Box and Image Box titles, Icon List, Heading links, Testimonial names and Menu Anchor links now keep their own colours, and a chosen Hover/Text colour is applied with node-level priority. Plain links in text still use the Site Settings link colours.
* Fixed: Site Menu "Text" colour did not reach its links, and the open dropdown list in the editor ignored it.
* Fixed: Site Menu colours given as rgba() or a global colour were dropped from the saved page.
* Fixed: Heading "Text Color" now also colours a linked heading; Icon List "Text Color/Hover" now reach linked items; Testimonial name colour reaches a linked name.

= 0.12.102 =
* Fixed: "Reset to Default" in Effects sections worked only once. After the first reset the button stayed greyed out and could not be clicked again until the page was saved and reloaded, because the button state was set when the panel was drawn and editing a value does not redraw the panel. The button is now always active, and its "modified" look updates live as you change any Effects value. Reset can be used any number of times, and each reset is its own undo step.

= 0.12.101 =
* New: every Effects section in a unit's settings (Advanced > Effects, Motion Effects, Transform, Layout & Effects, Border & Effects) has a "Reset to Default" button in its header. It returns only that section's settings to the unit's defaults, for all devices, in one undoable step. The button is greyed out while the section is already at its defaults.

= 0.12.100 =
* Fixed: Advanced > Effects settings (Transform: Translate, Rotate, Scale, Skew, Origin; CSS Filter; Transition; Blend Mode) now update the canvas live while you drag or type. Previously they only appeared on the page after saving.
* Fixed: Effects are painted on the unit wrapper in the canvas, the same element the live page styles, so the canvas matches the published page. Opacity is no longer applied twice in the canvas.
* Fixed: a Translate value typed without a unit is read as px in the canvas, as on the live page.

= 0.12.99 =
* Fixed: corrupted symbols in the editor. Icons such as the repeater drag handle, duplicate and remove buttons, and the close button on the A11y, Assets, Lock, Breakpoints and other popups showed mojibake (garbled letters instead of the close "x"). The editor bundle had stored these symbols in a double-encoded form. All 30 affected symbols are restored and stored as ASCII-safe escape codes.
* Fixed: text encoding hardening. Every PHP, JS and CSS file stores symbols as ASCII-safe escape codes or HTML entities, so no layer that guesses the wrong encoding can corrupt them. Canvas and maintenance templates and all Canvasly REST responses send an explicit UTF-8 charset. Text shortening uses UTF-8 aware helpers so accented and non-Latin characters are never cut in half. A documentation image that was saved in the wrong encoding is fixed.
* Fixed: Image Carousel canvas preview is now WYSIWYG. Arrows, dots, autoplay, the Slide and Fade effects, animation speed, infinite loop and right-to-left direction all work in the editor canvas, just as on the published page. Autoplay pauses while the pointer is over the carousel so it can be edited.
* Fixed: Image Carousel showed only part of the first image, with the next slide bleeding in. The carousel wrapper used the same CSS class as each slide, so it picked up slide sizing.
* Fixed: after adding an image to the Image Carousel, the canvas now moves to the new slide so it is visible right away.
* Fixed: Image Carousel slides show the saved image immediately in the canvas instead of a grey placeholder.
* Fixed: on sites using Plain permalinks, the editor could not load media details (image previews stayed grey) and some other editor requests failed with 404, because query strings were added with a second "?".
* Fixed: the Image Carousel Link option (None, Media File, Custom URL) was saved as a web address such as "http://none", so Media File links, the lightbox and custom slide links never worked. Pages saved with the old value are repaired automatically.
* Fixed: Image Carousel dots no longer cover the captions. With captions, the dots sit below them.
* Fixed: carousel images further along the slide track now preload once the carousel is on screen, so the next slide never appears blank. The slide offset is re-measured when images finish loading.
* Fixed: with "Pause on Hover" and "Pause on Interaction" both on, autoplay no longer restarts when the pointer leaves after you used the arrows or dots.
* Fixed: the Fade effect shows the first slide immediately on page load instead of starting blank.
* Fixed: the editor's brand menu shows the installed plugin version instead of a fixed old number.
* Slide position labels ("1 of 3") are translatable.

= 0.12.96 =
* Fixed: slider value boxes in widget settings (including Site Menu style controls, line height, letter spacing, and text shadow) no longer sit on top of their sliders.

= 0.12.95 =
* Fixed: an inherited theme header logo (including Header Footer Elementor site-logo widgets) could get clipped off the left edge of the canvas. The logo's column had no width constraint from a local capture, so it rendered at the source image's full size and pushed the header bar past the canvas.
* Fixed: a header logo using WordPress's native `loading="lazy"` attribute could stay blank in the canvas, because the browser's "is this near the viewport" check that native lazy-loading depends on never fires inside the canvas's offscreen iframe. Captured header and footer images now always load immediately.

= 0.12.93 =
* Publish from the editor. Saving a draft page (a converted Elementor copy, a page created with Add New Page, or any WordPress draft) now publishes it; the Save button reads Publish until it does. Page Settings gains a Status control to keep a page as a draft, submit it for review, or make it private.
* A save whose request body cannot be read (for example a payload the server dropped) is refused with an error instead of being stored as an empty page. Previously that emptied the document, so the editor fell back to previewing the Elementor source and units added after the import disappeared.
* Save errors returned by the server are shown in the editor status text.
* Revision snapshots keep escaped quotes in the document JSON, so restoring a revision with quoted text works.

= 0.12.86 =
* Converted Elementor pages open on the canvas. The editor no longer treats a toolbar element as the translator, so canvas sizing keeps running, and the page document is loaded from a JSON block instead of an attribute that large layouts truncate.

= 0.12.80 =
* Plugin header name matches the readme title: Canvasly - Visual Page Builder.

= 0.12.77 =
* Styles and scripts load through WordPress enqueue APIs, and only on the screens that use them.

= 0.12.76 =
* The Canvasly dashboard shows the Canvasly Pro annual price table when Pro is active.

= 0.12.74 =
* Menu Anchor shows its target on the canvas and scrolls the page to that ID. A sticky header can clear the target with the `--lb-anchor-scroll-offset` custom property.

= 0.12.73 =
* Header & Footer theme templates open both regions on one canvas.

= 0.12.72 =
* Container and widget mouse resize: grab left, right, top, or bottom; adjacent columns share width; size tooltip while dragging.

= 0.12.71 =
* PHPUnit (wp-env) tests for DocumentManager sanitization/migration, Style CSS output and REST permissions, Playwright editor flows (add, drag, responsive, save, undo, template insert), and a GitHub Actions CI workflow (Roadmap 7.7).

= 0.12.70 =
* WP-CLI commands (`wp canvasly-lite regenerate-css`, `flush-cache`, `replace-url`, `import`, `export`, `convert`) and an admin-bar Edit with Canvasly Lite node on the frontend and back end (Roadmap 7.6).

= 0.12.69 =
* Versioned upgrade framework (`Upgrades::run()` on plugin version change) with background-batched document migrations, a rotating logger under uploads/canvasly-lite/logs, and admin notices for failed upgrades (Roadmap 7.4).

= 0.12.68 =
* Maintenance / Coming Soon mode (saved template, role exclusions, HTTP 503 vs 200), per-user Safe Mode (editor loads without other plugins or the theme), System Info report + download, and plugin version rollback from stored ZIPs (Roadmap 7.3).

= 0.12.67 =
* Element Manager and Role Manager: enable or disable each element, restrict elements per role, usage counts, and role access of no access / content only / full. Design-system saves use `canvasly_lite_design` instead of `manage_options` (Roadmap 7.2).

= 0.12.66 =
* Admin settings screens (General, Integrations, Advanced, Performance, Tools, Features) with a single sanitized settings API, capability checks, REST `/settings`, Maps/reCAPTCHA keys, experiments, and editor iframe loader (Roadmap 7.1).

= 0.12.65 =
* oEmbed via wp_oembed_get with a host allow-list and transient cache for Video and Audio fallbacks, lone-URL HTML widgets, and a new Embed element (Roadmap 6.5).

= 0.12.64 =
* Elements declare `scripts()`/`styles()` WordPress handles; the renderer enqueues only assets the page uses. `CanvaslyLiteFrontend.registerHandler(type, fn)` runs for first paint and AJAX-inserted content (Roadmap 6.4).

= 0.12.63 =
* Element fragment cache for non-dynamic widgets (TTL and invalidation), lazy-loaded background images below the first one, fetchpriority=high on the first image with loading=lazy after, and an optional optimized-markup mode that removes extra node wrappers (Roadmap 6.3).

= 0.12.62 =
* Weight-aware Google Fonts loading (only used weights and italic styles), a font-display setting, preconnect hints, and optional local font hosting under uploads/canvasly-lite/fonts (Roadmap 6.2).

= 0.12.61 =
* External CSS files at uploads/canvasly-lite/css (global.css and post-{id}.css) with hash cache busting, a css_print_method setting (external or inline), minification, and a Regenerate CSS tool (Roadmap 6.1).

= 0.12.60 =
* Replace URL tool on Canvasly Lite → Tools (document JSON + CSS cache, dry run). WordPress importer/exporter keeps JSON meta valid, and post-duplication plugins copy Canvasly Lite document data (Roadmap 5.4).

= 0.12.59 =
* Convert stored layout JSON into Canvasly Lite documents: widget mapping table, sections/columns → containers, responsive breakpoint keys, global color binds, dry-run report, and a bulk tool on Canvasly Lite → Tools (Roadmap 5.3).

= 0.12.58 =
* Template shortcode `[canvasly_lite_template id=""]`, Gutenberg block (`canvasly-lite/template`) with picker and preview, Template widget, and a WordPress sidebar widget (Roadmap 5.2).
* Embedded templates enqueue their CSS, fonts and frontend scripts, with recursion protection and scoped selectors.

= 0.12.57 =
* Counter Number, prefix and suffix now update the canvas digits live while editing settings.

= 0.12.56 =
* Interactions 2.0: about 50 CSS entrance/exit presets, custom keyframes, viewport/load/hover/click/scroll-progress triggers, timing, per-breakpoint exclusions, reduced-motion handling, and an editor preview (Roadmap 4.4).
* Schema 2.8 migrates the legacy single `interaction` setting into the per-node `interactions` list.

= 0.12.55 =
* Collection Loop widget: query builder for posts/CPTs and terms, inline or saved-template item layouts, grid/list, and numbers / previous-next / load-more pagination (Roadmap 4.3).
* Term dynamic tags (name, description, URL, count) resolve inside a term loop.

= 0.12.54 =
* Dynamic tags no longer fatal when `Tag` is missing; the registry loads `class-tag.php` from the same directory.
* The plugin no longer defines `CANVASLY_LITE_DEV_MODE`, so a late `wp-config.php` define is not a PHP 9 error.

= 0.12.53 =
* Dynamic tags framework: extensible registry, per-control toggle with before/after/fallback, built-in post/site/user/archive tags, editor previews and frontend resolution (Roadmap 3.8).

= 0.12.52 =
* Action-level History panel with jump-to for add, move, edit, delete and related edits (Roadmap 3.5).
* Document snapshots are stored as WordPress revisions (legacy `_lb_document_revisions` meta is migrated). Preview a revision on the canvas before restore. Autosave uses the WordPress autosave revision.

= 0.12.51 =
* Persistent editor clipboard in `localStorage` so Copy / Paste / Paste Style / Copy All / Paste All work across pages and tabs (Roadmap 3.4).
* Clipboard payloads are schema-tagged and migrated on paste. Reset Style remains on the context menu and shortcuts.

= 0.12.50 =
* Keyboard shortcuts are a complete, rebindable map (save, paste style, navigator, responsive, library, history, preview, delete, Escape) with a cheat-sheet dialog (`Ctrl+?`) (Roadmap 3.3).
* Finder (`Ctrl+E`) searches pages, templates, components, classes, settings panels and editor actions.

= 0.12.49 =
* Code editor control (`code`) using WordPress CodeMirror (`wp.codeEditor`) for HTML, CSS and JS (Roadmap 3.2).
* HTML and Code elements, element Custom CSS, page Custom CSS, and Global Class CSS use the code editor.

= 0.12.48 =
* Visual group controls: slider with unit switcher, typography, border, background (classic/gradient/video/slideshow + overlay), box/text shadow, CSS filters, transform, transition, linked dimensions, choose icon groups, and gaps (Roadmap 3.1).
* Free-text transform, filter, background gradient, text shadow and transition values migrate to structured objects (document schema 2.6).

= 0.12.47 =
* Site kit export/import: ZIP packages of site settings, design tokens, theme style, classes, components, saved templates and optional pages with media, using merge or replace (Roadmap 2.4).
* Tools screen under Canvasly Lite and a Kit tab in Site Settings. REST endpoints at `/canvasly-lite/v1/kit`.

= 0.12.46 =
* Site Settings Layout tab: content width, widgets space, page title selector, default template, site identity (WordPress title/tagline/logo/favicon), global lightbox, and site background (Roadmap 2.3).
* Identity fields read and write WordPress core options. Lightbox captions can use alt, caption, or title.

= 0.12.45 =
* Theme Style in Site Settings: site-wide defaults for body text, H1–H6, links (normal/hover), buttons, images and form fields, compiled into the global CSS and previewed live on the canvas (Roadmap 2.2).
* Color fields in Theme Style can bind to global color tokens.

= 0.12.44 =
* Custom post type support: an enabled-post-types setting (default Posts and Pages) replaces hard-coded `post`/`page` checks so any public CPT can be edited with Canvasly Lite (Roadmap 1.4).
* "Edit with Canvasly Lite" now appears on every enabled post type's list table and in the block editor.

= 0.12.43 =
* Editor JavaScript is now built from ES modules under `src/editor/` with esbuild (`npm run build`). The bundled `assets/js/editor.js` is still shipped so the plugin runs without Node.
* No editor behaviour change: this is a source split and build step only (Roadmap 0.5).

= 0.12.28 =
* Widget depth: Accordion / Toggle (multi-item, icons, FAQ schema), Tabs (vertical, alignment, styles), Alert (dismiss), Video (YouTube / Vimeo / Dailymotion / VideoPress / self-hosted, overlay, lightbox, aspect ratio), Counter (count-up animation), Progress (styles, inner text), Divider (patterns, text / icon), Icon and Icon Box (stacked / framed views), Image Box, Icon List (inline, dividers), Social Icons (brand colours, shapes, grid), Star Rating (SVG, half stars), Testimonial, Heading (link, size presets), Text (drop cap, columns), Button (sizes, icon placement, alignment), Image Carousel (slides-to-show, fade, autoplay, captions), Gallery (captions, hover effects), SoundCloud (visual mode, player toggles).
* Container: semantic HTML tag, whole-container link, background overlay with blend mode, top / bottom shape dividers, self-hosted background video.
* WordPress Widget: choose any registered widget from a list; Sidebar picks from registered widget areas.
* Editor: element-aware select options, icon picker for every icon control, media picker for every image control, live previews for all widgets, frontend stylesheet loaded in the canvas, legacy single-panel Accordion / Toggle documents migrate to the items list.
* Frontend: script now loads whenever a page uses a script-driven widget; button colours / borders apply to the button itself instead of its wrapper.
= 0.12.27 =
* Element library: right-click on an element card again shows Add to Favorites / Remove from Favorites (the panel re-binding layers were dropping the listener).
* Image: visible resize handles now sit on the picture itself (right edge, bottom edge, corner). The image resizes live while dragging, keeps its aspect ratio (Shift on the corner stretches freely), shows its size, and saves % of the container (or px if the width was already px) for the current device.

= 0.12.26 =
* Frontend: a saved image width is now applied once (it was applied to both the wrapper and the image); per-device {desktop,tablet,mobile} width/height values now output their desktop value, so resizing on Tablet/Mobile no longer drops the Desktop width.
* Grid: a plain number in Rows (e.g. 3) now produces that many rows on the frontend; responsive gap values no longer collapse to 1px.
* Asset cache-busting version now follows the plugin version.

= 0.10.0 =
* Production Feature Depth release: Atomic element library, responsive design controls, typography/design controls, dynamic content bindings, design-system import/export, template library improvements, native form element, richer accessibility and editor workflows, and expanded Grid/media/WordPress integration foundations.

= 0.9.6 =
* Fixed isolated-canvas navigation caused by Button/Link activation.
* Editor Buttons now render as non-navigating editing controls.
* Added capture-phase navigation guards for anchors and interactive elements.
* Prevented Enter/Space activation from navigating the editor iframe.


= 0.9.2 =
* Fixed isolated editor iframe mounting so the canvas is populated after each render.
* Restored drag-and-drop from the Elements panel into the iframe canvas.
* Restored node selection, nesting, reordering, duplicate/delete handles and context-menu behavior inside the iframe.
* Added element type metadata to canvas nodes for reliable drop targeting.



= 0.8.4 =
* Element library single-click no longer inserts elements. Double-click inserts an element by click, while drag-and-drop inserts exactly once.

= 0.9.1 =

* Expanded responsive sizing, spacing, visibility and breakpoint-aware frontend CSS.
* Expanded Grid with explicit tracks, dense auto-placement, auto rows/columns and per-child placement controls.

* Google Fonts catalog integrated into Style > Typography & Design > Font Family with 1,600+ supported Google font names.

= 0.10.2 =
* Fixed Style > Typography > Font Family so the Google Fonts selector is populated directly in the editor.
* Added a native dropdown containing the bundled Google font family catalog.
* Fixed Google Fonts CSS2 URL construction for selected fonts.


= 0.10.3 =
* Fixed Style > Typography > Font Family so the primary control is a native Google Fonts dropdown.
* Populates the selector from Canvasly Lite's bundled Google Fonts catalog without requiring a network request to display the font list.
* Selecting a font updates the document and loads the selected Google Font for the editor preview.
* Added an explicit editor asset version bump to reduce stale browser/cache loading after upgrades.


= 0.10.4 =
* Fixed Font Family initialization so new Heading/Text elements immediately show Default in a real Google Fonts dropdown.
* Corrected plugin version constant and asset versioning to 0.10.4.

= 0.10.6 =
* Added a native WordPress-powered "TinyMCE Text Editor" element.
* Uses WordPress editor/TinyMCE assets via wp_enqueue_editor() and wp.editor.initialize().
* Double-clicking the element opens a stable TinyMCE editing dialog; single-click continues to select the element.
* Rich HTML is stored in the Canvasly Lite document and rendered as frontend HTML after WordPress sanitization.
* Added a focused Content panel action, TinyMCE toolbar, and editor lifecycle cleanup.

= 0.11.0 =
* Added Atomic Design System 2.0 with richer Global Classes, Variables and Components workflows.
